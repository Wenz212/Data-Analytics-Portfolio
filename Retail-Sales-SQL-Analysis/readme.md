Project Overview
This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using SQL and Excel.  
The goal is to uncover customer purchasing patterns, product performance, and seasonal trends.  
It demonstrates core skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and business insights generation.

Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Retail Sales Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)  
- Records: ~1,000 transactions  
- Fields: Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, Total Amount

Tools Used
- MySQL: Data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis  
- Excel: Pivot tables and charts for visualization  
- Tableau for dashboards

Key analysis
- How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?
- Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?
- Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?
- What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?
- How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?
- Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction?

Visualization
This project uses Tableau to visualize retail sales data after cleaning and transformation in SQL.
The dashboard includes several key analyses:
- Monthly Trend → Line chart showing sales performance across months.
- Seasonal Patterns → Pie/stacked bar charts summarizing revenue distribution across Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.
- Product Categories by Sales → Bar chart highlighting top-performing categories.
- Customer Behavior by Age × Category → Heatmap showing preferences of different age groups across product categories.
- Shopping Habits During Seasonal Changes → Stacked bar chart comparing how customers adapt spending in different seasons.
- Basket Size Behaviors → Box plots showing transaction value distribution based on quantity purchased.

All these charts are combined into an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer purchasing behavior, seasonality, and product appeal.
